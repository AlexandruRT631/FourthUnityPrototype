# FourthUnityPrototype

## What is this?

This is the fourth project from the fourth unit of the Junior Programmer Pathway from ```learn.unity.com```. In this unit, we had to make a game where the player is a ball and has to knock other balls out of the arena. There was also a challenge in which we had to fix a football game.

## Gameplay

### Prototype 4

In this game, the player controlls a ball and has to knock the other balls out of the arena. Inside the arena there are powerups, and if the player knocks all balls out, another hard wave will spawn.

### Challenge 4

In this game, the player has to control a ball and has to knock the other balls inside the goal before they reach your goal. This game also has powerups and a button to go faster.

## Controlls

### Prototype 4

The player can move the ball forward and backward and rotate the camera left and right.

### Challenge 4

This game has the same controlls as the other one plus a button to go faster (space).

## Building the game.

The game can be built by simply downloading the source code, opening it in Unity Hub, and using unity's utility to built the game for the desired platforms. Selecting which game is built is done by selecting which scene to built.
